The structure should be decided with your supervisor but typically will be something like: – Abstract (summary of report). 
– Introduction (outlines scope of investigation). 
– Background (survey of relevant literature, related approaches, sets wider context). 
– Research methods (what the project involves, project plan, and evaluation plan). 
– Progress – in whatever form is appropriate. 
– List of references (using accepted format).
Your Progress report should: 
– Contain an objective relating to evaluation that makes explicit the purpose of the evaluation. 
– Make a concrete proposal as to how your proposal will be evaluated. 
– Include time in the project plan for evaluation tasks. 
•Abstract 
• Contents
 • Numbered Sections 
– 1. Introduction
 – 2. Background & theory (if appropriate)
 – 3. Research (or experimental) methods 
– 4. Results and discussion 
– 5. Conclusion & future work 
• List of References 
•Abstract  
Should summarise the report – it is not an introduction.
 • Should summarise the results and conclusions of the report.
 • Should be informative (contain results) not just descriptive (say what the report is about). Method Worth 10% of the marks for your Progress Report 
• Introduction 
Section 1: Introduction and overview of the whole report or dissertation.
 • Section introductions: if a section has sub‐ sections then the text before 1st sub‐section should be an introduction of that section. 
• Same for sub‐sections with sub‐sub‐sections. Background & Theory 
• Section 2: Background and theory should provide the reader with sufficient knowledge to understand the results and discussion
 • If theory is important to the work, then appropriate equations and explanation should be given 
• Complete derivations are not needed 
Research (or experimental) methods
 • Section 3: Research methods this section should be used to describe the tools and techniques used 
• In hardware projects this would include instrumentation and experimental methods 
• In software projects it could include choice of programming language and software package and methods adopted 
Results and discussion 
• Section 4: What was actually done! – What advances have been made?
 – Discussion of data e.g. test results
 – What information can be deduced from the data
 – Detailed discussion of validity of conclusions 
Conclusions 
• More important than you think. 
• Use it to… 
– Give your overall conclusions 
– Reflect on your progress on each objective 
– Demonstrate what you learned 
– Discuss future avenues for investigation 
References 
• Two main styles: 
– Listed numerically in the order of appearance in the manuscript. Cited either like this [1] or like this1. E.g “Hartley showed that…[1]” or “Hartley1 showed that…” 
– Listed alphabetically and cited by (name, date) or name (date). E.g. “Hartley (1957) showed that…” or “It was shown that...(Hartley, 1957)”. • Word and latex will automatically create reference lists in either order
 – for latex use bibtex and use natbib for (name, date) style March 2016 COMP 60990 Scientific Method Slide 22/29 5) Formatting issues • Section numbers • Figures and Tables • Maths • Reference
